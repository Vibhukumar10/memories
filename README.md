## Introduction

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB, I made a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

Setup:

-   Install dependencies: `npm i`
-   Start server : `npm run dev`
-   Start client: `npm start`
